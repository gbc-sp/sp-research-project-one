            <p>
              Information Management is crucial for me as a recent graduate
              looking for work. While talking to a prospective employer, she
              told me that she found a link to a number of YouTube videos that I
              had created when I was younger. This was not the professional
              image that I hoped to share. As a result, I have carefully
              searched and changed privacy settings on my social media to make
              sure that I have managed my personal image. I know that care and
              attention to privacy is important for me and for those around me
              and also will reflect on how I care about the company and
              colleagues where I work.

          <p>
            Being a recent graduate I have been applying to a lot of jobs. I am
            anxious and feel as though I do not have the confidence I need to
            succeed. My main goal is to gain confidence in interviews and in the
            skills I developed in university.

          <h2>What I can offer a company is</h2>
          <p>
            I graduated my undergrad with honours and have gained relevent work
            expereience in placements. I am willing to work harder than most to
            prove I have the skills neccssary to succeed in my career.
